Diabetes Complication Prediction Tool
Hackathon Challenge Description
In the State of Israel, over half a million individuals are currently grappling with Type 2 diabetes. This project aims to leverage advancements in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to develop a tool that can predict and prevent life-threatening complications associated with this disease, thereby enhancing the quality of life for patients.

Task
Develop AI and machine learning-based tools capable of identifying and ranking the severity of complications in Type 2 diabetes patients. The goal is to foresee potential medical conditions and facilitate timely intervention, preventing severe complications such as blindness, cardiac failure, and limb amputation.

Requirements
At the end of the hackathon, participating teams are expected to present:

A trained predictive or severity-ranking model along with the results it generated.
A 5-minute pitch explaining the process and the solution developed, followed by a 2-minute Q&A session with the judges.
A technical justification for the chosen outcome measurement methods, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the utilized technology.
Predictions of medical conditions based on Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), substantiated by research and medical literature.
Resources
Participants will have access to:

A detailed dataset (additional external data can be incorporated to enhance project performance, but requires justification).
Mentorship from experts in various fields including medicine, software development, machine learning, and data science.
Training in the Stanford University Biodesign method, focusing on the development of viable solutions in Healthtech.
Support from the Israeli company Medint, offering opportunities to query real-time medical data.
Three suggested datasets covering cardiovascular risks, diabetic retinopathy detection, and diabetic foot ulcer classification.
Evaluation Criteria
The solutions will be evaluated based on:

Technological proficiency (40%): Including model selection and real-time applicability.
Medical relevance (40%): Including clinical relevance, patient impact, research basis, and medical innovation.
Additional criteria (20%): Including presentation skills, solution creativity, and user experience.
Code Structure
The project contains scripts for three different models tackling various aspects of the challenge:

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection: A deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The script contains data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation steps. (Refer to the code section 1)

Diabetic Foot Ulcer Classification: Utilizes EfficientNetB3 and OpenCV for image processing and classification. It includes data augmentation, model training, and evaluation. (Refer to the code section 2)

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction: Implemented using XGBoost, RandomForest, and KNeighbors classifiers. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and feature importance visualization. (Refer to the code section 3)
